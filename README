Special Instructions for Running Program: 
Anything Else For You To Know: I am so sorry I really did try my best. I've never coded more in my life.


Here is my pseudocode: 
First task: initialzie the heap so I can start allocating memory.

init_heap()
- first call sbrk(0)
    - will return a pointer to the start of teh heap
    - check if that value is divisible by 16
    - if it is, then proceed
    - if not, then make it divisible by 16 by moving the program break to the next location divisible by 16
    (the math for that is (boundary - (current number % boundary)) and then add that to the current boundary)
    (for example, if I wanted to make it aligned to 10 bytes, but I am at 15, I would do (10 - (15 % 10)) which is
    10 - 5 = 5. Then do 15 + 5 = 20, which is the next nearest boundary that is aligned with 10 bytes)
    - make the pointer point there instead of the start of the heap
- make the first sbrk call (sbrk(64KB))
    - create the first header and initialize the fields as NULL and 1 since the chunk is free
    - calculate the chunk size left 
        - 64KB - HEADER_SIZE
        - check if that value is divisible by 16
            - if yes, then continue
            - if not, then round up to the nearest value 
            - set that equal to firstChunk->size

Second task: now write a function that will traverse over the free chunks and check if they are large enough for what we need 
make a struct called ChunkInfo that keeps track of if enough memory was found or not, and a pointer to where that chunk starts
find_free_chunk()
- while the chunk's next pointer is not NULL
    - check if the chunk's size metric is greater than or equal to the chunk size you are looking for
        - if it is, then store a pointer to where that chunk header starts in memory in the struct
            (returning the pointer to the header, will calculate the actual start of usable memory in the malloc function)
    - if the the size you are looking for is not found, then store a 0 in the struct indicating not enough memory was found
- if the next pointer is null, put a 0 in the struct
- return the struct by value not as a pointer so that it gets stored on the stack instead of the heap


Third task: write a function that will go to the chunk with enough space and then split it up
it will take the amount given by the user, and allocate it 
what does "allocate it" mean? It means to take the chunk, and edit the header so that it now says its not free.
also change the size to be the size the user wanted to allocate
then from that header, find the locaation where the new free chunk starts 
do this by making a new pointer point to where the chunk started. 
move this pointer by the amount of bytes the user asked for + the header 
that will take you to where the new chunk starts
at that point, make a new header, implying that you are now creating a new chunk
make that say its free
calculate the new size of that which would be previous chunk size - what the user asked for + sizeof(header)
(might need to store the previous chunk size in another variable so that I can do this math? maybe in a global variable)
not sure what this function returns. 


- function takes in an instance of the chunk info struct
- go to the chunk by looking at the chunk struct region that has the start of chunk pointer that points to the header of that chunk
- change the header so that it is marked as used
- calcualte how much space is left for the new free chunk 
(current chunk size - requested size - sizeof(ChunkHeader))
- change the size field of the struct so that it is the user-requested size
- calculate where the new chunk starts (start_of_chunk_ptr + header + usersize)
- make a new header here 
    - set it to free
    - make the size as the calculated free chunk size - header 
- set the next pointer of the first chunk to point to the start of this new chunk
- set the previous pointer of the next chunk to point to the old chunk 
- return nothing 


another task:
now write a function for if the user asks for more memory, I need to be able to sbrk() for more and create a new header
- call sbrk(64KB) and add more memory
- set all of the chunk's fields
- find what the last chunk is in the current list, and set its next to point to this chunk
- so you have added on a new chunk 
- 


final task for malloc: putting it all together

malloc()
 - first check if the heap exists
    - if it doesn't call initialize_heap()
    - if it does, then go to next step
    - have a int variable act as a flag. 1 for successful memory found, and 0 for not found. 
    - call find free chunk
    - if the chunkInfo->enough_space = 1 
        call splitchunk
    - else
        ask more mem
        then split chunk


free()
pseudocode for free:
-check if the pointer given is NULL, if it is then return 
-take in the pointer

find_which_chunk()
-not guaranteed that the pointer points to the start of the ChunkHeader
-it can point to the middle of the chunk too 
-need to start at the global variable for the start of the linked list and traverse through
-check if the pointer given to free is between the start of the last node and the start of the next node 
-that will tell you what chunk the pointer is in 

-now that you know which Chunk, start at the header of that chunk 
-change the header to say that the chunk is now free
3 cases:
-first: current chunk isnt null and one before is free
    -combine those two 
    the prevchunks->prev = curentchunk->prev
-second: current chunk isnt null and one after is free 
    -combine those two 
    the nextchunks->next = currentchunk->next
-third: current chunk isnt null and one before and after are free
    -combine all 3
    prevchunks->prev = curentchunk->prev and nextchunks->next = currentchunk->next
-combine neighboring chunks
-return 

int combine_chunks(chunk1, chunk2)
-return a 0 if the combining did not go well
-return a 1 if the combining happened
-takes in a pointer to the current node 
3 cases:
-first: current chunk and one before is free
    -combine those two 
    -merge their sizes and update in the header
    the prevchunks->prev = curentchunk->prev
-second: current chunk and one after is free 
    -combine those two 
    -merge their sizes and update in the header
    the nextchunks->next = currentchunk->next
-third: current chunk and one before and after are free
    -combine all 3
    -merge their sizes and update in the header
    prevchunks->prev = curentchunk->prev and nextchunks->next = currentchunk->next
-by "combine" I mean to change the pointers so that the point to the right things 

realloc()
pseudocode for reallocating:

-takes in pointer to allocated memory
-takes in new size of how much to allocate 
-if the pointer taken in is NULL
    -just call malloc(new_size)
-if the size given to realloc is 0
    -free the pointer and return NULL
-if the pointer is not null and thesize is not zero
    -check if the new size < current size
    -calculate the current size - new size = leftover space
    -if leftover space > sizeof(header)+16 (the minimum chunk size)
        -make that into a new chunk
        -check if the next chunk is free
        -combine chunks
    -if not, then just leave it
    -adjust the pointers so that the new chunk is added to the linked list
    -find the header of that chunk
    -set its size to be currentsize - new_size
-if the newsize > current size
    -check if the chunk->next is free
    -check if the current chunk + next chunk is large enough
    -if it is, then combine chunks
    -then allocate by modifying the header and changing it to not free
-if its not then get more heap
-copy over the contents with mem move
-free the old chunk
-return a pointer to this new memory
